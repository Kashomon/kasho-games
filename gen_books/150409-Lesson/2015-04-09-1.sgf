Kashomon [1k\]: yea, in the game I extended along the side

Kashomon [1k\]: alright. I think that answers my questions about joseki, thanks =)
Kashomon [1k\]: What do most professional players play now? 
Younggil [8p\]: if you don't like those variations for White, you can simply play at K4

Younggil [8p\]: not recently
