;W[nc]C[## Four Stones and a Big Fight
### A Peaceful Opening

Kashomon [1k\]: This is a handicap game I played with a friend.  I don't think I played particularly well, but I'd like feedback for both sides, since I'm going to send him the feedback when we're done.

Younggil [8p\]: I see. That's a good idea.]

Kashomon [1k\]: Hm. I thought it was pretty close, no? Well... I thought it was close until I found that I could cut at C9.

Younggil [8p\]: It's close, but since it's 4 stones handicap, White is generally winning now.

Kashomon [1k\]: I see

Younggil [8p\]: If White loses 5 points, white can still win.
