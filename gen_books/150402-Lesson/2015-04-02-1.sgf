### Introduction

Kashomon [1k\]: This was a game I played with David Ormerod on KGS. I've mostly been taking Black + no-komi, but I played White in this game to switch it up.

Younggil [8p\]: So, do you prefer this to E17?

Kashomon [1k\]: I don't know! I haven't played this particular Joseki.

Younggil [8p\]: This move is getting less popular, because people think that it's not good.  In this variation, White's top is weaker.]

Kashomon [1k\]: G17 is a nice counter

Younggil [8p\]: Because White played at A, G17 is good and the hane at F18 is sente.

Kashomon [1k\]: Both Black's groups are pretty safe and White is weak.

Younggil [8p\]: Yea

Younggil [8p\]: Yea, White's top is still not solid enough

Younggil [8p\]: So here, if you were Black, where you wouldn't want White to play?

Kashomon [1k\]: I guess, if I were black I would worry about A.]

Kashomon [1k\]: This doesn't seem like a great result for White.

Younggil [8p\]: Because black has sente and the corner as well?

Kashomon [1k\]: Well, the stones in the top left can be separated with F14.

Younggil [8p\]: I see

Kashomon [1k\]: And then Black still has the opportunity to play around R10

Younggil [8p\]: Right. In this game, yes. But there's no good alternative after Black's hane at D18.]))))
