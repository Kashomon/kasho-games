### Introduction

Kashomon [1k\]: This was a game I played with David Ormerod on KGS. I've mostly been taking Black + no-komi, but I played White in this game to switch it up.

Younggil [8p\]: So, do you prefer this to E17?

Kashomon [1k\]: I don't know! I haven't played this particular Joseki.

Younggil [8p\]: This move is getting less popular, because people think that it's not good.  In this variation, White's top is weaker.]

;W[oc]C[Younggil [8p\]: This approach is very big, so the opening is still ok for White.]
;B[gc]LB[db:A]C[### Black Begins a Fight

Kashomon [1k\]: G17 is a nice counter

Younggil [8p\]: Because White played at A, G17 is good and the hane at F18 is sente.

Kashomon [1k\]: I think it's a little better for black.

Younggil [8p\]: Then what was problem?

Kashomon [1k\]: Both Black's groups are pretty safe and White is weak.

Younggil [8p\]: yea

(;W[oe]C[Younggil [8p\]: The game seems to be slightly better for Black, but still alright.
]
;B[pf]C[Kashomon [1k\]: I hadn't thought about that
Kashomon [1k\]: probably White needs to respond here
Younggil [8p\]: because, White's top is still not solid enough
Younggil [8p\]: yea
Younggil [8p\]: so here, 
Kashomon [1k\]: that you intend to have cut
Younggil [8p\]: if you were black, where you wouldn't want White to play?
Younggil [8p\]: yes right
Younggil [8p\]: or double hane
Kashomon [1k\]: I guess
Kashomon [1k\]: If I were black O would worry about R13
Kashomon [1k\]: *I
Kashomon [1k\]: but maybe that's too low
Kashomon [1k\]: err
Kashomon [1k\]: R12

Younggil [8p\]: this knight's move seems to be alright
Kashomon [1k\]: White 37 is where things felt like they started to go bad
Younggil [8p\]: i see
Younggil [8p\]: but since the pincer is loose at A, White can play more strongly here
Kashomon [1k\]: Because Black launched an attack on my top left stones
Kashomon [1k\]: hm
Younggil [8p\]: you mean B?
Younggil [8p\]: C?
Younggil [8p\]: or the big group from the top left?
Kashomon [1k\]: the big group
Younggil [8p\]: i see
Younggil [8p\]: they're still ok

Younggil [8p\]: yea

Kashomon [1k\]: This doesn't seem like a great result for White.

Younggil [8p\]: Because black has sente and the corner as well?

Kashomon [1k\]: Well, the stones in the top left can be separated with F14.

Younggil [8p\]: I see

Kashomon [1k\]: And then Black still has the opportunity to play around R10

Younggil [8p\]: Right. In this game, yes. But there's no good alternative after Black's hane at D18.]))))
