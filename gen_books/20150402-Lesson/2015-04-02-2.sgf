### Introduction

Kashomon [1k\]: This is another game I played with my friend Jared. He lost, but I'm going to write up the feedback and send it to him like I did for the game with Patrick.

Younggil [8p\]: yes
Younggil [8p\]: nornally black's better
Younggil [8p\]: but
Younggil [8p\]: in this game, it wasn't the first joseki on the board
Younggil [8p\]: and there were already many stones on the board
Kashomon [1k\]: I see
Younggil [8p\]: so White has more ko threats compared to normal other situations
Kashomon [1k\]: alright ,thanks
Younggil [8p\]: no worries :)
Kashomon [1k\]: I'll have to go study some more large-avalanche variations
Kashomon [1k\]: =)
Younggil [8p\]: Black didn't play badly, but you played well actually
Kashomon [1k\]: thank you
Younggil [8p\]: yes, that'd be good and fun

Younggil [8p\]: good
Kashomon [1k\]: from these two games
